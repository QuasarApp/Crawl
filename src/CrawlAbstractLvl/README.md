# ![CRAWL_BANNER](res/Abstract.jpg)

This level is a tutorial in which you are offered to pass a short level during which tooltips will be shown:
* How to control a snake.
* How to interact with game objects.

There are 3 types of objects in the level:
* Repulsive (blue) will push the snake side away from itself, just like the edges of the card.
* Destructive (red) destroys the snake.
* Buff (green) whose function is that it removes all obstacles visible on the screen.
